# Welcome!

Thanks for thinking about contributing to MailBrush. The more the merrier, and we'd love to have your help improving it.

These guidelines are here so we can all be on the same page. They also help ensure that your contribution can be safely and reliably added. In return for following the guidelines, we'll reciprocate in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## What types of contributions help?

MailBrush is an open source project, and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting [bug reports and feature requests](https://github.com/activecampaign/mailbrush/issues), or writing code which can be incorporated into MailBrush itself.

## Sources for Support

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Check whether the #MailBrush IRC channel on Freenode can help with your issue

### Technical and procedural considerations

* Create [issues](https://github.com/activecampaign/MailBrush/issues) for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Keep pull requests as atomic as possible, preferably one new feature per pull request.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct](http://activecampaign.com/open-source-code-of-conduct).

### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to MailBrush? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/activecampaign/mailbrush/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a little testing.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/activecampaign/mailbrush/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you've never contributed to open source before, here are a couple of friendly tutorials to start with: [http://makeapullrequest.com/](http://makeapullrequest.com/) and [http://www.firsttimersonly.com/](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/) Or learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile:

## Getting started

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Setup your local environment
3. Make some great changes in your fork
4. Submit a pull request with a detailed explanation of the change and reasoning.

## How to report a bug

### Reporting security issues

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, go ahead and submit it.

### Reporting a bug or rendering issue

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

* If it's a rendering issue in an email client, make sure to say which client. (And include a Litmus link if you can.)
  [] Email Client & Version
  [] Include a screenshot or link to the results of a Litmus test
* If it's a bug in the MailBrush package
  [] Include the error message if you saw one
  [] Try to include the relevant code that seems to be causing the error
  [] What did you see instead?

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist currently, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work. That way, we can discuss it int he open and determine whether it's a good fit for MailBrush.

### Code review process

The team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis, and we'll add notes to the pull requests if they require any changes. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
